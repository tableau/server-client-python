## Run the samples

Each of the samples requires the following arguments:

* `--server`. The URL for the Tableau Server that you want to connect to.
* `--username`. The user name of the Tableau Server account that you want to use. When you run the samples, you are
  prompted for a password for the user account that you enter.

Additionally, some of the samples require that you enter other arguments when you run them. For more information about
the arguments required by a particular sample, run the sample with the `-h` flag to see the help output.

For example, if you run the following command:

```
python samples/publish_workbook.py -h
```

You might see that you need to enter a server address, a user name, and a file path for the workbook that you want to
publish.
