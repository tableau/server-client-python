title: Populate Connections and Views
layout: docs

When you get a workbook with the TSC library, the response from Tableau Server does not include information about the
views or connections that make up the workbook. Similarly, when you get a data source, the response does not include
information about the connections that make up the data source. This is a result of the design of the Tableau Server
REST API, which optimizes the size of responses by only returning what you ask for explicitly.

As a result, if you want to get views and connections, you need to run the `populate_views` and `populate_connections`
functions.

## Populate views for workbooks

```py
workbook = server.workbooks.get_by_id('a1b2c3d4')
print(workbook.id)

server.workbooks.populate_views(workbook)
print([view.name for view in workbook.views])
```

## Populate connections for workbooks

```py
workbook = server.workbooks.get_by_id('a1b2c3d4')
print(workbook.id)

server.workbooks.populate_connections(workbook)
print([connection.datasource_name for connection in workbook.connections])
```

## Update connections for workbooks

```py
server.workbooks.populate_connections(workbook)
conn_to_update = workbook.connections[0]
conn_to_update.server_address = 'new_address'
conn_to_update.server_port = 1234
conn_to_update.username = 'username'
conn_to_update.password = 'password'
conn_to_update.embed_password = True/False
server.workbooks.update_conn(workbook, conn_to_update)
```

## Populate connections for data sources

```py
datasource = server.datasources.get_by_id('a1b2c3d4')
print(datasource.name)

server.datasources.populate_connections(datasource)
print([connection.datasource_name for connection in datasource.connections])
```
